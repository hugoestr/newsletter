Laws were put into place to remove Native American peoples from their land and set up reservations on which they were forced to live. As immigrants came over to the US looking for freedom and new opportunities, but they were given the lowest paying most dangerous and difficult jobs, such as factory workers, miners and agricultural workers. As Jewish, Russian, Asian and other people of color immigrated, laws were put in place to define which groups of people were "white".
